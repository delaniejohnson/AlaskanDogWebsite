<h1 class = "center underline"> Caring for Your Alaskan Dog </h1>


<h3>Training</h3>

<p>The training for these breeds will depend entirely on what they will be doing on a day to day basis.  If they will be used as a sled dog, they will need extremely specialized training in order to work well with their team and understand basic sledding commands.  If they will be for pleasure and companionship, their training should be like all other breeds: basic commands, leash training, socialization training, and food aggression training.  Above all, these breeds have a pack mentality and it is important that they recognize you as the alpha of the pack otherwise they may be a handful. </p> 


<h3>Grooming</h3>

<p>All of our dogs will require daily brushing at the very least.  They should also be regularly washed and groomed to avoid health concerns. The following benefits to Grooming are seen below: </p>

<h3>Nutrition</h3>

<p>Although a healthy diet can take a variety of forms, we suggest either a high-quality kibble or a raw diet consisting of either fish, fowl, or grassland annimals as the protein, probiotics to aid in digestion, and other vitamins and minerals derived from natural sources. </p>
